FriendBook is a full-stack social networking web app built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to create accounts, update profiles, send and accept friend requests, and maintain a personal friends list. The app supports secure authentication, real-time updates, and a responsive UI built with React. Users can interact through posts and manage their connections in a clean, user-friendly interface. The project demonstrates my skills in frontend–backend integration, RESTful API design, state management, and building scalable, interactive web applications.
